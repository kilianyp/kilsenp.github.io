# Kilian Yutaka Pfeiffer
## Work experience
### (05/2019 - 09/2019) @ Bosch Corporate Research
Worked on 2.5D object detection for indoor robotics (2D + Depth estimation).

## Scientific Work
### (10/2017 - 05/2019) @ Computer Vision Institute RWTH Aachen
Experimenting with triplet loss for Re-Identification. 
Supervised by Lucas Beyer, Alexander Hermans and Stefan Breuers.
[Project on Github](https://github.com/kilsen512/triplet-reid-pytorch)

Master thesis on the topic of "Multi-aspect embedding learning for person Re-Identification?"
### (10/2017 - 04/2018) @ Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group RWTH Aachen
Worked on Automatic Speech Recognition with RETURNN. Partially implemented experiments to replace CART labels.
Supervised by Albert Zeyer.

### (10/2016 -- 07/2017) @ Kitamura Laboratory Tohoku University Japan
Worked on hand gesture recognition. Implemented a TensorFlow version 
[R3DCNN](https://www.github.com/kilsenp/r4dcnn-tensorflow) network for hand gesture classification.
A study was conducted if it is possible to collect hand gestures in public for an individual dataset with the
help of a specially designed game called GestaMemory. Collected over 5000 samples in the span of 2 weeks.

Work was handed in at CHI 2018 but remains unpublished.
###  Bachelor Thesis @ Institute for Communication Technologies Embedded Systems (ICE) RWTH Aachen
Application Specific Instruction Set Processor 
Design for Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave 
MIMO Frequency Selective Channels

Designed an ASIP for a [hybrid beamforming algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7504275).
The ASIP was capable of executing around 1000 algorithm iterations per seconds after optimization.
The base design running an unoptimized version of the algorithm was capable of executing less than 2 iterations per second.
Work was presented in part at ChipEx 2017 by Markus Willems (Synopys).
Supervised by Juan Eusse and Andreas Bytyn

### Research Assistant @ Institute for Communication Technologies Embedded Systems (ICE) RWTH Aachen

Extended profiling tool for Application Specific Instruction Processors (ASIP) to support vector instructions.

## Projects
### T-Rex Game 
Trained an agent using Reinforcement Learning to play the T-Rex game which is hidden in the Chrome Browser.
Implemented network architecture and Q-loss function.

### Participation at DAC System Design Contest 2018 @ ICE RWTH Aachen:  
Working on algorithm side using the
[object detection framework](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) by Google.
### Slack Application Framework @ Microsoft Japan:  
A C# server that is capable of dynamically including Plugins to handle Slack commands. 
Supports /slashcommands, buttons and dropdown menus.
### GestaMemory @ Tohoku University Japan:  
A memory game designed to collect gesture samples in-the-wild.
Using [R3DCNN](https://github.com/kilsen512/R3DCNN-tensorflow) to recognize gestures.
